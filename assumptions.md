# **Assumptions**
Project assumptions provide a foundation for _planning and risk management_ for aspects of the project such as _scheduling, budgeting, and other things_. We will be documenting assumptions that include, but are not limited to, _resources, cost, and scope assumptions_.

This can also be comprehensively viewed on our [Confluence Page](https://unswcse.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/W09AANEMON/pages/394625778/Assumptions).

## **Resource Assumptions:**  
These are assumptions made based on the _availability, allocation, and utilisation of resources_. This can include things such as tools or the team’s expertise.

### **The project members have the skills and expertise required to perform their assigned roles effectively.**

> Ensure that allocated roles are given to members such that their abilities can be effectively reflected, and that the majority of tasks are within the team’s skillset.

### **The necessary technology is accessible to all members and are compatible with the project specifications.**

> Assess the required technology in advance to the later stages of the project (i.e. making sure everyone has access GitHub)

## **Cost Assumptions:**  
These are assumptions made based on the _budget and financial resources_ that a project has in order to deliver a satisfactory product.

### **The cost of the project should be low, if not entirely independent from financial aspects.**

> Thoroughly research easily accessible and free resources that the team can utilise throughout the project.

## **Scope Assumptions:**  
These assumptions refer to the requirements of the project scope. They encompass the functionalities and features of the end product. 

### **The project scope may change throughout its allocated timeframe.**

> Ensure that the requirements created leave room for flexibility, and are not too stagnant.

## **Time Assumptions:**  
These assumptions relate to the project schedule, duration, and sequence of tasks. They include task goals and dependencies that may impact the project timeline.

### **The tasks of the project should be achievable within the given timeframe.**

> Discuss and plan precise yet flexible steps ahead of time, including the estimated time each should take. Create an overall timeline.

### **The project will have dependencies, such that some tasks are required to be completed before being able to start others.**

> Investigate if a task has dependencies and identify what they are. Assign them their priorities accordingly.
